# The Anarchist's Workshop

This is a a bunch of code put together in order to run things at workshops.

As in, places where people work. Workshops.

The end goal is to have some Free Open-Source Software which can be installed
relatively easy by Rust developers, which can configure/extend/modify pleasantly
with good ol' Rust code, and install it on a computer from someone's grandparent
and who has recently wanted to open a workshop for making grandparent-like goodies.

It should be intuitive. Whatever that means.

## State of The Code

This project is in the earliest of it's development. We've only got a few ideas
and some time to spend on them.

## Motivation

The title is inspired by the work of one Christopher M. Schwarz, well-known woodworker,
bookwriter, publisher, etc. By reading his book about building his design for "The Anarchist Workbench".
Yes, from reading his book. It's good, and it's licensed with Creative Commons over at the
lostartpress.com, it's worth taking the time to look for it there, or somewhere in the
blog.lostartpress.com.
