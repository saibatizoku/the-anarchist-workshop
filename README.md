# The Anarchist's Workshop

This is a a bunch of code put together in order to run things at workshops.

As in, places where people work. Workshops.

The end goal is to have some Free Open-Source Software which can be installed
relatively easily on a computer, and be helpful from the start when running.

It should also be configurable, and people should be able to modify it as they
please. Make it do nicer things, or just do things a bit differently because
tastes are different.

It should be intuitive. Whatever that means.

## State of The Code

This project is in the earliest of it's development. We've only got a few ideas
and some time to spend on them.

For now, the prototype of a Workshop is in the works, and we want to keep track
of a few things with the computer:

* [  ] A registry of the tools that we have, with description of what they are
       good for (maybe by using tags and categories?), and a line or two about
       their location.
* [  ] A registry of raw material, the dimensions it has in storage, also a
       description of what it is good for (also tags & categories?)
* [  ] Etc.

## Motivation

The title is inspired by the work of one Christopher M. Schwarz, well-known woodworker,
bookwriter, publisher, etc. By reading his book about building his design for "The Anarchist Workbench".
Yes, from reading his book. It's good, and it's licensed with Creative Commons over at the
lostartpress.com, it's worth taking the time to look for it there, or somewhere in the
blog.lostartpress.com.
